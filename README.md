Data Management Plan for the research project Influence of Environmental Factors on Selection of Backcountry Campsites.

Context of the project:

This project explores potential relationships between environmental factors in a landscape and the selection of campsites by backcountry users. The project uses data on actual selected campsites, simulates data on available campsites for selection, and uses remotely-sensed data layers to quanitfy landscape factors. The project is exploratory and looks to understand the extent to which environmental variables are adequate predictor variables for selection of a campsite from among available campsites.
