Data Management Plan for the research project Influence of Environmental Factors on Selection of Backcountry Campsites.

Context of the project:

The question of interest for this research is understanding the extent to which landscape features influence the selection of backcountry campsite locations among backcountry users in a park. Given the parkâ€™s remote location and its designation as a pristine Wilderness area, people are interested in understanding patterns of use among current backcountry users. As such, this research focuses on understanding the importance of the landscape features to selection of campsites by backcountry user groups. 

This project explores potential relationships between environmental factors in a landscape and the selection of campsites by backcountry users. The project uses data on actual selected campsites, simulates data on available campsites for selection, and uses remotely-sensed data layers to quanitfy landscape factors. The project is exploratory and looks to understand the extent to which environmental variables are adequate predictor variables for selection of a campsite from among available campsites.
