# Data description

The research question will be answered with three types of datasets. A human-subjects dataset of movement data representing user travel collected from backcountry user groups will be used to identify used campsite locations. Several publicly available raster datasets will be used to quantify landscape features. Additionally, publicly available vector datasets will also be used to quantify landscape features.

# Roles and responsibilities

Data collection and generation:
Data collection was from human subjects was the responsibility of a team of graduate students working in the field. Data were collected from backcountry users during their trips in the backcountry. Raster and vector data collected from publicly available sources is the respondsibility of one graduate student working on research questions associated with these data. 

Protection of sensitive and protected data:
Protection of sensitive data is the responsibility of the principle investigator on the research team; however, each individual researcher and graduate student on the project has the responsibility ot uphold human subjects training and IRB data collection approvals when dealing with human subjects data. It should be noted, the data collected for this project is not of a sensitive or private nature. 

Instrumentation and Maintenance:
The responsibility to select and test instrumentation was a team effort, with the ultimate responsibility residing with the PI but actual testing and fine tuning carried out by graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. The maintenance of the instruments in the field was the responsbility of the team of graduate students collecting data onsite.

Data Organization:
A post-doctoral researcher is responsible for implementing the data organization for the human subjects data and the graduate students are responsible for following that data organization plan. The organization of the publicly available data is the responsibility of the graduate student working on the research questions using that data.

Metadata Generation:
Generation of appropriate metadata is the responsibility of the individual graduate students working on cleaning, organizing, and generating variables for analysis for this project. Each time editions are made to a dataset or new data are created from original data, the metadata should be documented. Ultimately, the PI for the project is responsible for setting and upholding the metadata standards, while the graduate students are responsible for implementation. 

Quality Control:
Quality control checks occur at several stages in the data collection and analysis process. It is the responsibility of individual graduate students and researchers working with the data to check the data to ensure that prior to a new analysis being performed, the data serving as "inputs" are correct and of a high quality.

Data Analysis: 
Primary role of the graduate students on the project is data analysis, with responsibility for the analysis being formally held by the project PIs.  

Data Management Plan Implementation:
The project PI is responsile for DMP implementation among the project team. This individual assigns roles and sets standards for the team to follow.
